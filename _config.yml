  This is a blog by myself (Austin Shipp) which demonstrates HTML and CSS practices and applications that I have learned. Hopefully this will help anyone learn something by explaining it in my own words.
baseurl: "/aca-blog" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://RocketShipp.github.io.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
